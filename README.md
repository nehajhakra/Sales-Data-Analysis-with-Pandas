Sales Data Analysis with Pandas 🚀


Unlock Insights from Raw Data!
In this project, I’ve harnessed the power of Pandas to transform messy, raw sales data into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions. By cleaning, aggregating, and visualizing key data points, I’ve uncovered hidden trends, identified top-performing products, and analyzed monthly and regional sales performance—all with a few lines of Python!

What’s Inside 🔍
Data Cleaning: Tackling missing values, transforming dates, and calculating new metrics like Total Sales.

Aggregated Insights: Get the lowdown on sales by region, top-selling products, and monthly trends.

Stunning Visuals: Create insightful visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn to tell the story behind the data.
